Setup R &amp; RStudio Keep things up-to-date", " Technical R Bootcamp Michael Ames | amesam@wfu.edu 2020-05-04 Welcome This is the course website for “WakeForest’s MSBA Technical Bootcamp in R”. The goal of this five day course is to help you get comforatable with using R and RStudio for data science. You’ll learn how to get your data into R, shape it, transform it, and visualise it. After working through each day’s exercises, you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challgens using R. What is R? When you see powerful analytics, statistics, machine learning and visualizations used by data scientists, chances are that the R language is behind them. Open-source R is the analtyics programming language that data experts the world over use for everything from mapping broad social and marketing trends online to developing financial and climate models that help drive our economies and communities. R is one of the most popular programing languages for data science and statistics. R is popular because: R is open source i.e. it’s free R has latest ML methods R is easy to learn R is fun Setup R &amp; RStudio You need to install two pieces of software. First you download and install R, then you download and install RStudio. RStudio is the interactive development enviornment that we’ll be using. In fact this website was created entirely with RStudio. Download and install R, you can get it for free at https://cran.rstudio.com/ Download and install RStudio, you can get that free at RStudio Once you’ve installed R &amp; RStudio check that it’s working by Selecting: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script Figure 0.1: New R Script Next type the following command summary(cars) click “Run” Figure 0.2: Run R Script and you should see the following in the console Figure 0.3: Console Output Keep things up-to-date A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions, which require you to reinstall all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. "],
["day1.html", "Day 1 - Getting Started 0.1 Create a Project 0.2 Use R Notebooks! 0.3 Mastering Markdown", " Day 1 - Getting Started Create a Project Follow instructions in day_1_notebook.Rmd 0.1 Create a Project RStudio projects make it easy to mange our work, by putting everything in our a working directory, the .proj extention maintains our workspace, history, and source files. RStudio projects are associated with a directory on your computer. I recomend creating a directory on your computer to put all of the class material in there. To create a Project Select: File &gt; New Project Figure 0.4: New Project Next &gt; Either Select Existing Directory or New Directory Figure 0.5: New Directory New Directory Figure 0.6: New Directory Select where you want your directory created and stored Figure 0.7: New Directory Give it a name Figure 0.8: New Directory click create. Going forward just open the project instead of a an R script file. 0.2 Use R Notebooks! I plain hate R script(hate is a strong word, really just dislike), and fortunatly there is an alternative - *** R Notebooks*** . Notebooks are a cool, modern interface that allows you to document your code and results all in an interactive development environment. An R Notebook is an “R Markdown” document with chunks-o-code that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input. 0.2.1 Lets create a notebook Figure 0.9: New Directory 0.2.2 Put some code in it. Figure 0.10: New Directory 0.2.3 Run interactively Figure 0.11: New Directory 0.2.4 Knitt the whole thing Knitting runs your code in a separate session and produces an HTML file of your notebook. Don’t worry about Knitt to PDF or Word, we’ll stick with making HTML and “printing them to PDF”. Why? it takes too long to setup “Knit to PDF and Word” you can do that another day.
