"Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act will create millions of jobs, lower costs for working families, and meet the moment on climate change. 

These are transformative investments in the American people and our future."
Tribal lands have been chronically underfunded for generations. I’m proud to say that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be the single largest investment in Tribal infrastructure ever—and we won’t stop there.
"Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, next year will be the first year in 20 years that American infrastructure investments will grow faster than China. 

Historians will look back at this time as the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century."

And as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll rebuild the economy from the bottom up and middle out. That’s what the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Build Back Better Act will do."
"The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the most significant investment in public transit in the history of our nation.

We must pass the Build Back Better Act to lower costs for working families and help get people back to work."
The Build Back Better Framework will strengthen the middle class by bringing down costs on everyday essentials and enacting tax cuts for the middle class—and we’ll get it done by asking the wealthiest to pay their fair share.
"The Build Back Better Framework will be the largest effort to combat climate change in American history—and through this effort, we’ll grow industries here in the United States; create good-paying union jobs; and combat environmental injustice."
"Our economy has created 5.6 million jobs since January and unemployment is below 5%. 

But Americans across the country are facing prices that are just too high. We must pass the Build Back Better Act to lower costs for working families and help get people back to work."

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will strengthen the supply chain and reduce bottlenecks, and Build Back Better will ease inflationary pressures and lower costs for working families."
